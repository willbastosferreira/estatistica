Trata-se de um sistema de pesquisas por amostra de domicílios que, por ter propósitos múltiplos, investiga diversas características socioeconômicas e demográficas, umas de caráter permanente nas pesquisas, como as características gerais da população, de educação, trabalho, rendimento e habitação, e outras com periodicidade variável, como as características sobre migração, fecundidade, nupcialidade, saúde, segurança alimentar e outros temas que são incluídos no sistema de acordo com as necessidades de informação para o País.*\n",

        "A distribuição Normal é a mais familiar das distribuições de probabilidade e também uma das mais importantes em estatística.\n",
        "\n",
        "A curva de distribuição normal representa o comportamento de diversos processos nas empresas e muitos fenômenos comuns, como por exemplo, altura ou peso de uma população, a pressão sanguínea de um grupo de pessoas, o tempo que um grupo de estudantes gasta para realizar uma prova.\n",
        "\n",
        "A distribuição normal pode ser usada para aproximar distribuições discretas de probabilidade, como por exemplo a distribuição binomial. Além disso, a distribuição normal serve também como base para a inferência estatística clássica.\n",
